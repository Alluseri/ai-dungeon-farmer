6. Click "+10 Actions" as many times as you want
7. Refresh the page before proceeding

## Advanced
### Node.js
1. `npm install node-fetch@2.6.7`
2. `node ai-dungeon-farmer.min.js`, you can pass the authtoken(including the "session" part) and the useragent in command line arguments, or enter them interactively.
3. Type in some not-very-high number, like 10 or 100.
4. Enter
5. Wait

### Fast Mode
Replace `false` in `var EnableFastMode = false` to `true`. Less reliable, but should work nevertheless.
